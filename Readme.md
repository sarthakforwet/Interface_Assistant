# Interface Assistant
This project aims to build an Interface Assistant. By interface I mean we would
have a UI through which we can talk with our assistant. 

This assistant works on Rule-Based AI and this project too in one way shows you how
Rule-Based voice assistants work.

Currently I have included only the functionality of searching for anything from
`wikipedia` to show developers new to this field that how a function would work
so that they can build their own functions. 

I insist the developers to implement new and innovative `functions` for this
assistant because it is `dumb` and only work what you implement. Implementation
of `functions` by developers who are quite getting started would prove to be
beneficial for them so go on with it.

Reach me out if you are not getting idea of what to implement as I have also
made a personal assistant for me which has functions like -
- Sending SMS to people. (Used [Fast2SMS](https://www.fast2sms.com/))
- Sending mail to people.
- Opening Games of my choice.
- Playing my favourite music playlist.
- Searching through wikipedia.
- Search for any youtube videos.


- Change the name `Sarthak` to your name in the Script to make your assistant greet to you.
