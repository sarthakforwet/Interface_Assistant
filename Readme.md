# Interface Assistant
This project aims to build an Interface Assistant. By interface I mean we would
have a UI through which we can talk with our assistant. 

This assistant works on Rule-Based AI and this project too in one way shows you how
Rule-Based voice assistants work.

Currently I have included only the functionality of searching for anything from
`wikipedia` to show developers who are new to this field that how a function would work
so that they can build their own functions. 

I insist the developers to implement new and innovative `functions` for this
assistant because it is `dumb` and would only work on the `functions` you
implement.

Implement your own `functions` and submit them as a PR to make this assistant more
and more powerful.

Reach me out if you are not getting idea of what to implement as I have also
made a personal assistant for me which has functions like -
- Sending SMS to people. (Used [Fast2SMS](https://www.fast2sms.com/))
- Sending mail to people.
- Opening Games of my choice.
- Playing my favourite music playlist.
- Searching through wikipedia.
- Search for any youtube videos.


Change the name `Sarthak` to your name in the Script to make your assistant greet to you.
